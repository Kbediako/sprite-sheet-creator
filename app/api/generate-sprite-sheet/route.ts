const WALK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking to the right.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Right leg forward, left leg back - stride position
Frame 2 (top-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Left leg forward, right leg back - opposite stride
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition back

Each frame shows a different phase of the walking motion. This creates a smooth looping walk cycle.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const JUMP_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art jump animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is jumping.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Crouch/anticipation - character slightly crouched, knees bent, preparing to jump
Frame 2 (top-right): Rising - character in air, legs tucked up, arms up, ascending

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Apex/peak - character at highest point of jump, body stretched or tucked
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Landing - character landing, slight crouch to absorb impact

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const ATTACK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art attack animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is performing an attack that fits their design - could be a sword slash, magic spell, punch, kick, or energy blast depending on what suits the character best.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Wind-up/anticipation - character preparing to attack, pulling back weapon or gathering energy
Frame 2 (top-right): Attack in motion - the strike or spell being unleashed

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Impact/peak - maximum extension of attack, weapon fully swung or spell at full power
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Recovery - returning to ready stance

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right. Make the attack visually dynamic and exciting.`;

const IDLE_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art idle/breathing animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is standing still but with subtle idle animation.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Neutral standing pose - relaxed stance
Frame 2 (top-right): Slight inhale - chest/body rises subtly, maybe slight arm movement

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Full breath - slight upward posture
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Exhale - returning to neutral, slight settle

Keep movements SUBTLE - this is a gentle breathing/idle loop, not dramatic motion. Character should look alive but relaxed.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;
